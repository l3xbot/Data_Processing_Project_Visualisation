# Chicago Crime (2008-2012) - Visualisations
    
As part of my AI and machine learning program, I just finished a data processing course. During the course, I worked with Python modules such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Plotly Express.
    
For the last assignment, I analysed crime data from Chicago to answer various questions.
    
    
Note: This is only a select portion of the assignment, and not the entire project (i.e. not all questions are included). In this notebook, I specifically want to showcase the data visualisation work I've done. 😁
